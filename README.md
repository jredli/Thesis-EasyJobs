This is my first real and a bit more complex web application.

Before this one, I was mostly learning different techologies and figuring out which one will grab my attention the most.

EasyJobs was a web application for easy finding or creating job posts. 

A user can filter through active jobs or create his own. Also he can send his CV to a certain job owner.

Administrator can publish jobs posts and comments, edit/delete users, change most of the content on the website. Add new jobs types/categories/lines of work...

Technologies used:Codeigniter, Html5, Css3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AJAX and MySQL database
